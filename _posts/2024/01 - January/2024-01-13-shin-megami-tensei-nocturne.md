## This Ain't Your Dad's Pokemon

_Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne_ was first released in North America on October 
12th, 2004. However, this version was not the original version that was first 
released in Japan on February 20th, 2003. North America received a slightly 
updated version of _Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne_ (from this point on referred 
to as just _Nocturne_). The equivalent version to this in Japan would be the 
"Maniax" version.

In this Maniax version, some cut content was added back in, alongside some 
extra features. This includes a completely new ending obtainable after 
completing an additional dungeon. The most memorable change in this version 
overshadows this though; the addition Dante from the _Devil May Cry_ series. 
For Maniax, Dante replaces all instances of Raidou Kuzunoha, although they 
largely serve the same role in the game.
