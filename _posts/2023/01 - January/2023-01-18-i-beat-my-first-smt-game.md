# What is SMT? (Grossly Oversimplified)
I'll try to abridge this explanation as best as possible. Shin Megami Tensei, or SMT, is a series of RPGs made by Atlus, 
who is a subsidiary of Sega. What separates them from your typical high fantasy RPGs with wind-swept hairstyles and 
self-insert protags is the depth of the combat systems.

If you've played Pokémon, it's actually not much different, except instead of a 10 year old solving the problems of 
adults for 10-20 hours, you're using demons of various origins to attack and dethrone God. It's hard to identify the 
similarities between this and Pokémon, but at their core mechanics, they're both creature collectors with turn-based 
combat. If you wish to know just how deep the rabbit hole goes, Atlus' MegaTen 
[wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megami_Tensei) is an excellent place to start.

## So What Game Did I Beat?
I beat the 5th numbered installment of the series, _Shin Megami Tensei V_ for the Nintendo Switch. It released in 
November of 2021, though I didn't get around to playing it until December of last year. I remember when this game was 
first teased, which was **during the Switch's unveiling in 2017**. Back then, the most exposure I had had to the 
franchise was _Persona 4 Golden_, which got a port to the PS Vita if anyone remembers that handheld.

If you're unaware, the _Persona_ series is a spin-off of _Shin Megami Tensei_. _Shin Megami Tensei: Persona_, or just 
_Persona_, started as an experimental game that asked you to balance the albeit simpler combat of an SMT game while 
managing relationships forged through the other half of the game via slice-of-life moments. Ironically, I haven't 
finished P4G myself, though I know the general story beats and the ending. That's another game on my 
[ever-growing backlog](https://ggapp.io/StuckBoy/want-to-play).

## Should I try SMT?

Yes. This isn't even a biased answer. If you like occult stuff, the concept of warring beliefs or just turn-based RPGs
in general, you should give an SMT game a shot. Obviously do some research on what mechanics, setting or system you can
play it on, but absolutely you should try to play at least one. As long as you are aware that not every SMT game is a 
perfect entry point, you should be able to find one that best suites your interests. The biggest limiting factor is 
likely what platforms they are available on.

If you have a Switch, then you already have access to both of the biggest entries in the SMT franchise, namely SMT 5 and
SMT 3: Nocturne. If you've heard of SMT, you probably heard about it through Nocturne. It's frequently touted for being
incredibly difficult and annoying given that random encounters happen everywhere. However, seeing as the fighting is a 
core element of the gameplay loop, it's important to remember that the random encounters aren't to hinder your progress 
to the next content, they _are_ the content.

SMT 5 doesn't nearly have this problem, as every enemy is visible on the overworld, so encounters you don't want to take
can simply be avoided. As for the difficulty, the recent remaster of Nocturne has included a merciful difficulty, 
allowing people who are more interested in seeing the story an avenue as well.

If you have an Xbox or PlayStation that is newer than 2012, you have the next widest library to choose from. In addition
to 3 and 5, you'll also be able to experience a sequel to another SMT franchise, _Soul Hackers 2_. I haven't experienced
it myself, but seeing as how it's the next newest game in the franchise, it may have more of the quality of life changes
you desire in your video games.

However, without a shadow of a doubt, the best way to experience the franchise will forever be through PC. Seeing as how
a PC can effectively be any console prior to the Xbox One and PS4 era, it has access to every SMT game that you can 
obtain. Again, please do your research, as some games like _Devil Survivor_ assume you have a competent understanding 
of how the fusion mechanics work for demons.

### <a name="Combat">Combat</a>
Combat follows the standard structure of each character having a turn in, except the order is always the same for your 
party. Each party member has an Agility stat, but that affects far more than the instances where turn order must be 
decided. Basically, if your team goes first, everyone on your team goes before your opponent. You start with 4 possible 
moves that are used when attacking or using items. However, if you can either strike a weakness of an enemy or land a 
critical hit, you use 1/2 a move instead. Effectively, you're gaining an additional use of an action, up to a maximum 
of 8 total actions you can take for the entirety of your turn. There are multiple ways that this ability can be 
utilized, either to deal maximum damage with weakness-exploiting attacks, or allow for support or healing demons to 
prepare your party for the next round of enemy moves.

Unfortunately, it's not all positives when it comes to the press turn system. For instance, if you miss an attack, you 
waste the move you just used, and an _additional_ turn from your pool, regardless of whether you utilized the extra 
turns from them or not. In the worst case scenario, your attack is canceled out by an enemy, or reflected back at you. 
This means you lose **all remaining actions**. It heavily incentivizes you to study your opponent, and not abuse 
attacks that target the entire enemy side to save time.

Fortunately, there's an upside to all this. Enemies follow the exact same rules you do. Meaning, if your team is 
structured in such a way that they reflect, absorb or cancel an attack, you can force the enemy to pass their entire 
turn. Thus, you're incentivized to prepare accordingly for the current boss or mini-boss. This is drastically different 
from how Pokémon handles bosses, where enough leveling of a very powerful Pokémon will eventually allow you past the 
road block. That's not to say that similar behavior is _impossible_ in SMT, but it's leagues more efficient to actually
prepare a better team.

I'm a sucker for mythology of various origins. Luckily for me, I've been living under a rock all this time, as SMT 
draws inspiration from all those and more. At any given time your party will have multiple pantheons of demons such as 
Thor, Apsaras or even an Archangel. The contrast of designs and mythos are made more apparent as your three main demons
occupy the same space on the field while the rest wait on your bench. Having multiple party members present on the field
and their designs contrasting or even showing similarities is another reason I think I was able to finish my 
playthrough of Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth. That and the edgey designs that quite a few digimon possess. If you prefer 
visual examples, search up _official_ artwork for Mastemon, Ravemon or Diaboromon.

It's no secret that at this point in my life, I've become increasingly frustrated by the designs that pokémon have 
received. Ultimately this is personal bias because the games still sell in obscene quantities and if it's not broken 
they aren't fixing it. I just don't understand why a rabbit eventually evolves to wearing pants or largely follows a 
soccer aesthetic. As I don't want to spend the rest of this post dissecting my grievances with a children's RPG, I'll 
shift focus into what make SMT and Pokémon different.

### <a name="Mechanics">Mechanics</a>
As you progress through the game, your roster of recruited demons will begin reaching a rather large size. Thus, the 
player can devote slots to favorites that don't have a replacement yet, or still serve a niche that newer demons don't. 
As for Pokémon games, you typically are constructing a team of 6 party members, with the goal being a team that can 
overcome the next challenge presented to the player. This is where the design philosophies differ again. In Pokémon, a 
majority of your team will go unchanged the entire playthrough. For people who have played Pokémon before, how many of 
them require you to replace most of your team because they're too weak for the current gym, or can't learn moves that 
allow them to cover for types you might not have? What's worse is that depending on how generous the Pokémon game 
is, you may only ever replace one or two party members during the entire journey.

In contrast, the only slot in SMT games that will never change is the slot for your protagonist. This is mostly for 
lore reasons, but also because the protagonist is in theory the strongest demon you'll ever have. As your protagonist 
progresses through the plot, they'll be met with opportunities to add skills to their repertoire, allowing the player 
to shape their protagonist to their whim. This is a point in which playthroughs can be vastly different, even with the 
same pieces. In one playthrough, you may allocate most of the protagonists skills to different elements, allowing them 
to always exploit the weaknesses of your enemies. In a later playthrough you may decide that it's better for your 
protagonist to be a support or healer type, leaving the job of bruiser to your other party members. Coincidentally, 
since your protagonist must stay relevant the entire game, they naturally level at an increased rate compared to 
demons. To explain just _how_ different these two franchises handle this problem, let's once again use a comparison 
from Pokémon. 

In every main entry, a specific evolution line or type will be harder to raise than others. This is usually a dragon 
type, or a dual type featuring dragon. They also don't show up until the end of the game, as they are so powerful that 
they can take down end game parties single-handed. They may require a ton of grinding to make relevant, again to 
offset the massive benefits you'll eventually possess. Now imagine that every pokémon required that much investment to 
stay relevant. Regardless of the SMT game you're playing, demons you recruit along the way will take exponentially more 
experience to keep them useful for the given challenge your character is facing. If this sounds scary, fear not, as 
this is by design, and encourages the use of the rest of the systems SMT offers. Namely, negotiating with new demons, or 
fusing old ones to make slightly more powerful ones.

#### By Our Powers Combined (Is this reference too old?)
By incentivizing you to replace weaker demons by fusing or recruiting new ones, your party's plan can slowly shift from 
one that is decimated by the current roadblock to one that laughs as your opponent wastes their turns having their 
attacks absorbed or reflected back, canceling the rest of their turn in the process. Once, I had a party comprised of 
glass cannons, intent on wiping out enemies before they had a chance to retaliate. I've also had a team that 
specialized in debuffs, buffs and siphoning resources from enemies to sustain themselves.

There are additional benefits to fusing demons besides maintaining a play style you prefer or bringing the right 
resistances for the enemy. One, you can always buy back the demons you're losing, in the last state you saved them as 
in your compendium. This is less like a PC in Pokémon, and more like a bookmark to a website. Then, when you encounter 
another enemy whose weaknesses you've already prepared for, you can pull from this repertoire of demons to quickly 
overcome them. Two, the skills your outdated demons possess are the keys to success that their fusion result desires. 

You may be creating a demon who is a powerhouse with high strength, but their best moves have low accuracy. They may be 
decent as they currently are, but through the power of fusion, we can bestow upon them the abilities necessary to 
overcome their weaknesses. An example that solves the previously mentioned demon's problem would be to take a skill 
called Concentrate from one of the fused demons and giving it to the resulting one. Now, the power house demon can use 
the skill they shouldn't have to prep for attack phases, giving them a 100% hit rate and making it a guaranteed 
critical.

As I progressed into the later portions of my playthrough, I began to notice an additional benefit that this system 
allows. Demons that share a particular typing such as Femme, Devil or Megami can exploit another type of demon known as 
Elementals. Elemental demons possess an interesting feature that when they are fused with, they will either upgrade the
demon to the next strongest one for its type, or it will downgrade to the previous one. Adding this into the already 
packed toolbox of mechanics meant that building optimal teams was as painless as they could possibly make it.

This can result in interesting circumstances where your party is resistant to most skill types in the game, ignore 
losing turns if an attack is repelled or absorbed, or buffing themselves to allow for overhealing and increasing its 
potency.

### <a name="Music">Music</a>
This section comes second last because it's the one that I resonated with the most. Simply put, the soundtrack to this 
game is phenomenal, though from what I've learned that's almost expected from every SMT game. Basic encounters, 
mini-bosses and even certain enemies have their own themes. Some sound inspired from heavy metal while others are a 
fusion of EDM, ornamental instruments and organs. There are references to other songs in nearly every track, which I'm 
a complete sucker for. My personal favorites are 
[_Battle -Droll-_](https://youtu.be/nULL6VlAoAg), 
[_Spiral_](https://youtu.be/2BioYLaeVzI) and 
[_Battle -Dancing Crazy Murder-_](https://youtu.be/OjACNTXzxOY).

Another thing I'm a complete sucker for is when a soundtrack is composed alongside your actions. That is to say, the 
current game state and actions the player is taking are adding or removing elements to the overall soundtrack. Examples
of this include the alternate theme when riding a Yoshi in Super Mario World or the speed of a song is affected by your 
moment, like the levels in Super Mario Galaxy where you are balancing on a ball.

The instance where this happens the most in SMT 5 is in overworld fights. So long as your team wins the initiative, you
aren't greeted with a kick in the chest from the soundtrack. Instead, you're met with vague guitar strums that are 
almost like droning. This moment can only occur once each battle, and the duration of which is until the player chooses
their first action. By doing this, the impact of that first move matches the opening of the song. It's hard to find an 
example using actual battle footage, but [this is the best example](https://youtu.be/WqS6Fmf7tWE) I could find where the opening is included with the song.

If you've listened to enough SMT music, you'll also start to notice a trend that most combat tracks adhere to. The 
openings are typically loud and up front, but are also divided up into moments where the harmony is allowed to take 
center stage, which mimics the pacing of combat going from engaging action to tactical planning. The added bonus of 
including so many incredible but rarely used tracks is that most don't hit a point of being overused. However I feel 
that this is more of a benefit that SMT 5 alone has, and not so much the other titles in the series.

### <a name="Summary">Summary</a>
It's not an understatement to say that I will be thinking of this game randomly for the rest of my life. I'll be at the 
beach or walking through a grocery store and a song from the game or a mechanic I remember using will collide with 
whatever I was originally thinking about. It will be the RPG I compare subsequent ones to, even if they aren't from the 
same franchise. I'm a big supporter of games that inspire the rest of their genre, whose mechanics echo throughout 
other titles hoping to capture a bit of the essence that made that cult classic such a great entry.

Obviously since SMT 5 is my first real foray into the _Shin Megami Tensei_ series, it will be the standard I use to 
compare older titles, for better or worse. I'm excited to experience what else is out there, and there will probably 
be moments those games do better than SMT 5 could.
