# Why?
Basically, I've become very jaded about every social media site I've used over the years.

# But Why a Blog?
It allows for longer posts than Twitter, and it's not squashed between ~~advertisements~~ sponsored posts, and it's 
presented in the order that god intended, chronologically. Also, I was inspired by [this blog](http://startafuckingblog.com).

# Was it Hard to Start One?
Not really, it took about an hour or so of setup after following their guide.

# How Often Will Posts Happen?

Idk, whenever inspiration hits me. I'll try to aim for at least once a month.
