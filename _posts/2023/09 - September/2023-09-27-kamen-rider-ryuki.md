# Kamen Rider Ryuki
## What's a Kamen Rider?
[Kamen Rider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamen_Rider) is a Japanese superhero series that started way back in the year of 1971. In this series, a man transforms into a bug-themed superhero to fight evildoers while riding a motorcycle.
If you've ever see Power Rangers or anything in that vein, it should sound incredibly familiar. Much like Power Rangers,
the evildoer(s) in each episode is destroyed using a finishing move. In this case, it's a flying jump kick named a 
"Rider Kick". 

Kamen Rider Ryuki is the first Kamen Rider series I've seen in its entirety, but it's actually the second series I've 
seen, with the first being Kamen Rider Kabuto. They both originally aired in the 2000's, but Kabuto came later in 2006. 
I'm hoping that someday soon Kabuto can get its own western release, but I'm unfortunately not holding my breath. 

## Where Does Ryuki Come In?
### Overview
[Kamen Rider Ryuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamen_Rider_Ryuki) is the twelfth entry in the series, airing in 2002.
Kamen Rider as a series at this point in time was beginning to focus more on independent story-lines that were isolated
to that particular installment. Watching it today was almost like experiencing a time capsule of technology and trends 
that honestly made it more interesting to watch. Cameras at this point were still trying to catch up with emerging 
technology, and the CG that is present is far more noticeable than it is today, but I honestly didn't mind as it meant 
that quite a few elements were still fashioned out of necessity.

### Incredibly Simplified Plot
When I found out about the premise for Ryuki, I was honestly shocked given how frequent the core idea has become 
throughout both media and gaming. Essentially, the thirteen riders that comprise the series are competing in a battle 
royale in order to obtain the power necessary to grant their one wish. The desire differs between riders, but each uses 
that as their motivation for joining the fight. 

For the main character, Shinji Kido, he joins in an attempt to halt the fight, however futile that sounds. His 
reasoning focuses on the fact that as long as the fight continues, innocent bystanders could be hurt. Other riders' 
motivations range from wanting immortality, to be recognized as a hero, and simply as a means to fight.

Every rider forms a "contract" with a particular monster, gaining abilities that represent the original monster, in 
addition to an outfit with similar styling. The monsters originate from a mirror world copy of the everyday one that 
the characters inhabit. This is tenuous at best, as the monster can deem you unworthy and kill the host if they so 
choose. Upon forming his contract, Kido gains the powers of Kamen Rider Ryuki as seen below:

When a contract is formed, the rider obtains a deck of cards, each of which provides them a certain type of power. This 
can include a weapon based on the monster they represent, a shield, an ability, or a finish move. Finishing moves in 
this series are referred to as "Final Vents". This finishing move is repeated frequently throughout the show as a way 
to ~~pad for time~~ hype up the finale of a fight. Below is the rendition as featured throughout Ryuki:

## Kamen Rider is Like Bacon and Eggs
Regardless of which series of Kamen Rider you first experience, you'll likely begin to notice more of the similarities 
as you watch more of them. However, the earliest of series tend to have a much more prominent lead, with side 
characters occasionally being focused on for particular story beats. As you near more recent series, the cast as a 
whole begins to be prominently featured on a regular basis.

With Ryuki, the main character Kido tends to fall in the category of comic relief and moral compass.
