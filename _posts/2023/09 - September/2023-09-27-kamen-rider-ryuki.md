# Kamen Rider Ryuki
## What's a Kamen Rider?
[Kamen Rider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamen_Rider) is a Japanese superhero series that started way back in the year of 1971. In this series, a man transforms into a bug-themed superhero to fight evildoers while riding a motorcycle.
If you've ever see Power Rangers or anything in that vein, it should sound incredibly familiar. Much like Power Rangers,
the evildoer(s) in each episode is destroyed using a finishing move. In this case, it's a flying jump kick named a 
"Rider Kick".

## Where Does Ryuki Come In?
[Kamen Rider Ryuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamen_Rider_Ryuki) is the twelfth entry in the series, airing in 2002.
