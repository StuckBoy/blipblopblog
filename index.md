## My Internet Presence

### Professional Stuff

#### <a href="https://github.com/StuckBoy">GitHub</a>
I've been trying to get back into programming as a hobby, though with enough 
other things to keep my occupied my commit history tends to be sporadic. There's
a few projects in various points of development, scripts I just like having 
handy and some old code that I used back in my school days.

It's basically business Facebook, and I check it about as often as I check real
Facebook.

### ~~Gremlin~~ Personal Endeavors

#### <a name="Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/stuckboy_">Twitter</a>
It's a lot of ramblings and fan art retweets, it's also the primary social media
I'm connected to, until Musk decides to send the rest of the company up in 
flames.

#### <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/stuckboy">Twitch</a>
Be warned, the occassions where I stream are few and far between, mostly because
I usually can only gather enough energy to be outwardly positive for a few hours
a month. If I am streaming, it's more than likely a second playthrough of 
something I'm going to gush about for 3 hours or speedrunning something.

There really isn't much to see here. I've considered running several games but
have only worked up the effort to practice and record a couple. I have several 
hurdles I'd like to clear to make this easier, but for now it shall remain 
barren.

#### <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvyCu3MGnhN6oL6TiY-5hog">YouTube</a>
Mostly VODs, which I'm also behind on. Anything I can get a recording of that 
I'd like to display usually ends up here _eventually_.

#### <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/stuckboy_/">Steam</a>
I primarily play on PC if a game is available on multiple storefronts. I don't 
typically focus on full clearing games unless they're particularly interesting
to me. I also have far too many games and figured publicly shaming myself would
convince me to play more of these games rather than something I've already 
beaten for the 6th time.

#### <a href="https://ggapp.io/StuckBoy">Gaming Backlog</a>
I recently came across GG| for tracking my video game backlog and I've been 
enjoying the experience so far. Here you can see what games I'm currently 
playing, shelved, have yet to start, or abandoned. There's also lists that may 
or may not be ranked.

#### <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/Stuckboy">My Anime List</a>
I'm not 100% confident that this is up to date most of the time, but if you're 
interested in seeing what anime or manga I've gone through, this is the easiest
place to check. If you check this at any point and are upset by your findings,
please do not take time out of your day to criticize my tastes, as I could not 
possibly care any less.

#### <a href="https://techhub.social/@stuckboy">Mastodon</a>
This will be my primary fallback should [Twitter](#Twitter) go up in smoke.
