# My Internet Presence
Hi! If you're seeing this I'm honestly surprised, unless you're a bot scraping 
every URL it can find, you probably stumbled in here from a link posted across 
one of the sites listed below. In case that's what you're looking for, I'm not 
sure why you navigated away from that site. However, if there's a site below 
that piques your interest, feel free to check it out using this handy 
crossroads of internet shortcuts.

## Professional Stuff

### <a name="GitHub" href="https://github.com/StuckBoy">GitHub</a>
I've been trying to get back into programming as a hobby, though with enough 
other things to keep my occupied my commit history tends to be sporadic. There's
a few projects in various points of development, scripts I just like having 
handy and some old code that I used back in my school days.

### <a name="LinkedIn" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachary-stuck-746835121/">LinkedIn</a>
It's basically business Facebook, and I check it about as often as I check real
Facebook. To be quite honest I don't get _why_ business-oriented social media 
is even a thing. Regardless of how you feel you can hear about my worksona over 
there.

## S O C I A L S
### <a name="Bluesky" href="https://bsky.app/profile/stuckboy.bsky.social">Bluesky</a>
I really hope this gets opened up to the public but to be quite honest I really
like their system of referrals only. I tend to have a lot of spare codes too so
perhaps I should try to make some more internet friends...

### <a name="Mastodon" rel="me" href="https://techhub.social/@stuckboy">Mastodon</a>
If this type of thing ain't your thing, I get it. It has some things I really 
like, but it feels like it's much easier to miss out on quite a bit. At the 
very least it's there in case **another** SM I actually like using decides to 
either sell out or allow a man-child to make it their personal bot dumpster.

## Gaming
### <a name="Gaming-Backlog" href="https://ggapp.io/StuckBoy">Gaming Backlog</a>
I recently came across GG| for tracking my video game backlog and I've been 
enjoying the experience so far. Here you can see what games I'm currently 
playing, shelved, have yet to start, or abandoned. There's also lists that may 
or may not be ranked.

### <a name="RetroAchievements" href="https://retroachievements.org/user/StuckBoy">RetroAchievements</a>
I've been trying to make it a habit to play games while connected to 
RetroAchievements. Projects like these are always fun, even if they're just 
more silly internet numbers that go up while you do other stuff.

### <a name="Speedrun.com" href="https://www.speedrun.com/user/Stuckboy">Speedrun.com</a>
There really isn't much to see here. I've considered running several games but
have only worked up the effort to practice and record a couple. I have several 
hurdles I'd like to clear to make this easier, but for now it shall remain 
barren.

### <a name="Steam" href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/stuckboy_/">Steam</a>
I primarily play on PC if a game is available on multiple storefronts. I don't 
typically focus on full clearing games unless they're particularly interesting
to me. I also have far too many games and figured publicly shaming myself would
convince me to play more of these games rather than something I've already 
beaten for the 6th time.

### <a name="Twitch" href="https://www.twitch.tv/stuckboy">Twitch</a>
Be warned, the occasions where I stream are few and far between, mostly because
I usually can only gather enough energy to be outwardly positive for a few hours
a month. If I am streaming, it's more than likely a second playthrough of 
something I'm going to gush about for 3 hours or speedrunning something.

### <a name="YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvyCu3MGnhN6oL6TiY-5hog">YouTube</a>
Mostly VODs, which I'm also behind on. Anything I can get a recording of that 
I'd like to display usually ends up here _eventually_.

## Everything Else
### <a name="Goodreads" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/171345438-zachary">Goodreads</a>
I recently got back into reading for pleasure and it's honestly become a bit of 
an addition. My history is probably completely wrong since I was filing 
everything I've read for as long as I can remember.

### <a name="My-Anime-List" href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/Stuckboy">My Anime List</a>
I'm not 100% confident that this is up to date most of the time, but if you're 
interested in seeing what anime or manga I've gone through, this is the easiest
place to check. If you check this at any point and are upset by your findings,
please do not take time out of your day to criticize my tastes, as I could not 
possibly care any less.
